      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I was first introduced to programming through <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>'s <abbr title="User-Interface">UI</abbr>-based programming platform <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about">Scratch</a>. In high school I began to learn more about "real" programming languages like C and Java.</p>
      <p>Right now, most of my programming experience is in Java and C++. And of course, this website is proof of my growing experience with HTML/CSS and Javascript. I have some experience using ActionScript, a bit of Python knowledge, and I've dabbled very slightly in Lua.</p>

      <h2>Scratch</h2>
      <p>The idea behind Scratch is that kids could experience the joy of building their own project "from scratch" and watch it come to life.</p>
      <p>I used it for a variety of things, but as an example, here is a small game I made 3 years after I first started playing around with Scratch:</p>
      <div class="centered">
        <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/32225274/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen>Dusk (Game)</iframe>
        <aside class="centered">
          <em>Controls: Arrow keys to move and jump, Space to switch sides, Toggle music with "m", Toggle blur with "b", Restart level with "r"</em>
        </aside>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>ActionScript</h2>
      <p>ActionScript is one of the programming languages supported by Adobe Flash. The main lesson I learned from working in ActionScript is that most <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> languages are essentially the same. The only two things I need to work in any unfamiliar language are:</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>A basic knowledge of core features (loops, variables, objects, etc.)</li>
        <li>Access to a language-specific syntax sheet</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With these two, I was able to build fun animations and small games using Adobe Flash. And I learned many valuable lessons about programming and animation along the way.</p>

      <h2>Forge and Java</h2>
      <p><a href="http://files.minecraftforge.net/">Forge API</a> is a code library designed to allow modifications to the open-source game "Minecraft." The game and API are written in Java. One summer long ago, I jumped in head-first by teaching myself Java in order to learn to use the Forge API.</p>
      <p>My use of Java improves continously as I learn new skills and best practices. Also, working with other <abbr title="People who develop programs to modify Minecraft">modders</abbr> over the years has given me a chance to learn many skills, such as how to work with a development team and how to communicate properly.</p>
      <p>A YouTuber generously showcased my first mod, released in 2015. Their video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMKrasOs56c">here</a>.</p>

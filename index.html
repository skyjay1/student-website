      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my page. It's not much right now but it's growing.</p>
      <p>I'm currently a student, so the purpose of this page is to practice and showcase what I have so far.</p>
      <p>While I've moved around plenty, I've lived in three main areas throughout my life:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Southern Utah</li>
        <li>Northern California</li>
        <li>Northern Utah (current)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I specify "northern" and "southern" because the environment and culture in north Cali is very different from the Bay-Area, LA-and-SanFran culture found in the south.</p>
      <p>Likewise, southern Utah is more like extra-north Arizona &mdash; hot and dry, with none of the snowboarding and skiing that makes northern Utah famous.</p>
      <p>Anyway, check out the rest of this site to find out more about me. Thanks!</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>When I have free time between homework assignments, I have several projects that I like to work on. The main purpose of the coding projects is to practice and learn new concepts. There are other sections of this page with more information, but here's a brief overview of what I like to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketching, drawing, and jewelry crafting</li>
        <li>Minecraft mod development</li>
        <li>Avoiding drowning in homework</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My programming experience includes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>ActionScript (Flash)</li>
        <li>Lua</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When I'm not obsessed over one of my coding projects, I spend time with friends. I can only handle so much socializing, though, so I escape into my art when I need a break.</p>

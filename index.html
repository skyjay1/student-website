    <section>
      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my page. It's not much right now but it's growing.</p>
      <p>I'm currently a student, so the purpose of this page is to practice and showcase what I have so far.</p>
      <p>[More content coming soon]</p>

    <!-- Interests and hobbies -->
    <section>
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>When I have free time between homework assignments, I have several projects that I like to work on. The main purpose of the coding projects is to practice and learn new concepts. There are other sections of this page with more information, but here's a brief overview of what I like to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketching, drawing, and jewelry crafting</li>
        <li>Minecraft mod development</li>
        <li>Avoiding drowning in homework</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When I'm not obsessed over one of my coding projects, I spend time with friends. I can only handle so much socializing, though, so I escape into my art when I need a break.</p>

    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
    <!-- Introduction to my coding experience -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I was first introduced to programming through <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>'s <abbr title="User-Interface">UI</abbr>-based programming platform <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about">Scratch</a>. In high school I began to learn more about "real" programming languages such as C and Java. Finally, in university, I greatly expanded my coding horizons.</p>
      <p>Other languages and libraries I have used include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C&#x23;, .NET, Unity</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and JavaScript</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li><abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> and MongoDB</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One huge idea in software development is that all <abbr title="Object-Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> languages have remarkably functionality. The important concepts (loops, variables, objects, etc.) can be applied everywhere. With a syntax sheet and some decent documentation, I have no doubt that I could learn any language that the situation requires.</p>

      <h2>Scratch</h2>
      <p>The idea behind Scratch is that kids could experience the joy of building their own project "from scratch" and watch it come to life.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="games.html#scratch">Games</a> tab for a simple game I made 3 years after I started using Scratch.</p>

    <!-- Background in Java using Minecraft Forge -->
    <section>
      <h2>Forge and Java</h2>
      <p><a href="http://files.minecraftforge.net/">Forge API</a> is a code library designed to allow modifications to the open-source game "Minecraft." The game and API are written in Java. One summer long ago, I jumped in head-first by teaching myself Java in order to learn to use the Forge API.</p>
      <p>My use of Java improves continously as I learn new skills and best practices. Also, working with other <abbr title="People who develop programs to modify Minecraft">modders</abbr> over the years has given me a chance to learn many skills, such as how to work with a development team and how to communicate properly.</p>
      <p>A YouTuber generously showcased my first mod, released in 2015. Their video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMKrasOs56c">here</a>.</p>

    <section id="coding-camp">
      <h2>Coding Camp 2021</h2>
      <p><a href="https://simplycoding.org">SimplyCoding.org</a> is a summer program that teaches coding to kids who are ages 11-15. In June and July of 2021 I was an instructor for SimplyCoding for these courses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minecraft Mods in Java</li>
        <li>Intro to Java</li>
        <li>JavaScript Game Design</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My responsibilities included creating lesson plans, team-teaching a class either virtually or in-person, and providing one-on-one instructure as needed.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="games.html">Games</a> tab for some of the projects that I created for the JavaScript course.</p>
